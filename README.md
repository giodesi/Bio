## Scientific Writings
- Contains theses and scientific works; specifically:
  - **'Delay Numerical Modeling of Epidemiology'**
    - This thesis, written by me, concerns the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic that started spreading along the Italian peninsula from the end of February 2020. The main purpose of this thesis is the creation of a forecast model — based on Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) — that manages to alert the decision-making bodies and, in particular, the healthcare system, to hinder the emergence of any other pandemic outbreaks or the arrival of subsequent pandemic waves.
  - **'Introduction to Algorithms and Programming'**
    - Notes, written by me, related to the "Introduction to Algorithms and Programming" course (Second Cycle Degree/Two-Year Master in Artificial Intelligence) offered by the University of Bologna and held by Professor Simone Martini.
